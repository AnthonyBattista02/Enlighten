# Enlighten

### Enlighten is a game created for a game jam hosted by Big Mode. The theme set for the game jam is "Power". The Game Jam is hosted from January 24th 2025 at 9:00 AM to February 2nd 2025 at 11:59 PM, but due to personal life I was only able to work on it from January 26th 2025 to February 2nd 2025 at 11:59 PM 
## Story
### You are climbing through different environments and solving power based puzzles in order to allow for access to electricity for your home village.
## Gameplay
### This is a 2D Platformer/Puzzle Game. Movement includes left, right, and vertical with different systems that can affect your movement such as ziplining and jumping from a zipline which translates your gained velocity from its original direction to going directly up allowing you to reach new heights unreachable before. Puzzles include a breaker puzzle that is done in almost every level that when completed turns on the light in the room by however well you completed the puzzle. Water is used as an obstacle as well as a handy reset option if you wanted to retry a puzzle for better lighting. That is the current scope however if there is any extra time it will be used to create more interesting puzzles that can be used to open new pathways or move platforms for more variety of gameplay.
## Process
### This was made using Godot and planned using Lucid (linked below).
